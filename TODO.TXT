- CI
  - right now: can't run within docker and report back the XML result files
    - reson: Collision between ts-node typescript runtime compiler/runner & mocha-reporter. The result is node's limit of event subscribers (file system events) is exceeded. Hard cap at 10, tried changing but no luck...
    - possible fix: run outside docker?
    - if fixed: get xml output from all tests and CI is unblocked

- Folder ABI Source Tests
  - doesn't run on windows. reasons is because it manipulates the file system, and windows perms don't like node doing this... couldn't find a work around.
  - maybe a problem with rimraf?
  - maybe don't use ts-node/register, build to JS then run the tests...?

- Blob Tests
  - run against blob emulator instead of live blob in azure
  - improve coverage, it only does happy path right now...

- Transaction Proxy Error Handling
  - Better solidity method overloading errors

- Functions
  - Use notary api source locally instead of via NPM package
  - more error handling in functions to better understand what's going wrong
  - investigate ABI caching (move new ContractRepo outside exports?)
    - how would this handle threading, no locks

- standard OS stuff
  - contribution guidelines
  - integration guidelines
    - how someone could use the function as a service themselves
    - how to create their own service with the api (point to examples/example.ts, maybe outside of dist for npm package?)
  - better readme + one for the API package
